# This example configuration is for a vindriktning containing no additional modules. It should mostly 
# replicate the functionality of the origional vindriktning.
# This configuration will add a switch for a light to your homeassistant dashboard which toggles the status
# LEDs between a low brightness dark mode and a full brightness mode
